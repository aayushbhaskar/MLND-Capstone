Apart from the standard python libraries like numpy, os, sys, random etc, the other major libraries that I have used are tensorflow, for all the deep learning processing and model evaluation; and OpenCV, for preprocessing the images in the dataset. In addition to these two, I also have used tensorflow's tensorboard module to generate visuals for the project.Tensorboard for jupyter notebook can be easily installed by writing pip install jupyter-tensorboard on the terminal line.
